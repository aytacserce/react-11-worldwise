---

This is a travel app project built with React with following functionality and key concepts:
- We can;
  - login to the app using a fake authentication (handled on the client side) and logout,
  - let the app get our position and show it on the center of the map with a marker,
  - click the places on the map that we had visited and get that position's information on a form,
  - pick the date which we had visited this place, add some notes and save the city to a fake api,
  - display visited cities from the api and display their details once clicked as well as center the map to the selected city,
  - delete cities from the visited list.
- In this project; json-server, react hooks, geolocation, protected routes, and especially context API were practiced.
